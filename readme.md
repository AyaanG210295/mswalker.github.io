Dear Teacher,
I hate to bother you on a weekend, but this is an emergency. As you know, I run a small construction company, however, business is slowing down and I have decided to change my business model to offering premium cat-hotel solutions.

After watching 'The Social Network' I thought I would be able to edit the website myself. I actually broke it. I heard you had just trained a whole new batch of junior developers and perhaps if they could find an hour this week, they could have a look.

Here is what I need:
- Fork the current version of my site. You must go to www.github.com/mswalker and fork "mswalker.github.io" to your own account
- Under the words 'unleash', 'synergize', and 'pro-cats-stination' there should be beautiful pictures! I tried to change the link path in the CSS!
- Put the page-footer text in the center
- Can you make all the text in the contact form 30px? Can you explain to me why changing the font size of the contact form in the code does not affect the rest of the text in the website?
- When the mouse hovers over the buttons 'engage now' and 'check now', it's a really ugly bright green. Can you change the hover colour?

Thank Mew,
Mrs. Whib
